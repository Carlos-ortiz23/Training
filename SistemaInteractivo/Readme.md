# Interactive System - Age Validator

This is a simple interactive web project created as a student exercise. The system allows users to enter their name and age, and then displays a personalized message based on their age.

## How does it work?

- The user enters their **name** and **age** in the form.
- When the "Validar" button is pressed, the system:
  - Checks if the age is a valid positive number.
  - If the age is 18 or older, it shows a message for adults.
  - If the age is less than 18, it shows a message for minors.
  - If the age is invalid, it shows an error alert.

## Technologies used

- **HTML5** for the structure.
- **CSS3** for the styles.
- **JavaScript** for the interactive logic.

## How to use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Enter your name and age, then click "Validar" to see the result.

## Project files

- `index.html` – The main web page with the form.
- `styles.css` – The style sheet for the page.
- `sistema.interactivo.js` – The JavaScript file that handles the form logic.
