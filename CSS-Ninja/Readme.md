# CSS Ninja Training

Welcome to my CSS Ninja Training project!  
This is a simple web page where I practiced using CSS to create cool effects and layouts.

## What did I do?

- I created a web page with a header, three content sections, and a footer.
- I used **CSS Flexbox** to center everything on the page.
- Each content box has a **dark metallic gradient** background that moves, making it look like brushed metal.
- The header has a fun animation where each letter in the subtitle bounces up and down.
- The footer stays at the bottom and has a link that changes color when you hover over it.
- The design is **responsive**: on small screens, the content stacks vertically and the text stays readable.

## What did I learn?

- How to use **flexbox** to center and arrange elements.
- How to make **gradients** and animate them for a metallic effect.
- How to use **CSS animations** for fun text effects.
- How to make a web page look good on both big and small screens (responsive design).
- How to style links and add hover effects.

## How can you use it?

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Resize your browser window to see how the layout adapts!
